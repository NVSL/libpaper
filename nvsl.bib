abstract = {Emerging fast, non-volatile memories will enable systems with large amounts of non-volatile main memory (NVMM) attached to the CPU memory bus, bringing the possibility of dramatic performance gains for IO-intensive applications. This paper analyzes the impact of state-of-the-art NVMM storage systems on some of these applications and explores how those applications can best leverage the performance that NVMMs offer. Our analysis leads to several conclusions about how systems and applications should adapt to NVMMs. We propose FiLe Emulation with DAX (FLEX), a technique for moving file operations into user space, and show it and other simple changes can dramatically improve application performance. We examine the scalability of NVMM file systems in light of the rising core counts and pronounced NUMA effects in modern systems, and propose changes to Linux's virtual file system (VFS) to improve scalability. We also show that adding NUMA-aware interfaces to an NVMM file system can significantly improve performance.},

abstract = {Non-Volatile Main Memories (NVMMs) promise an opportunity for fast, persistent data structures. However, building these data structures is hard because their data must be consistent in the wake of a failure. Existing methods for building persistent data structures require either in-depth code changes to an existing data structure using an NVMM-aware library or rewriting the data structure from scratch. Unfortunately, both of these methods are labor-intensive and error-prone.Pronto is a new NVMM library that reduces the programming effort required to add persistence to volatile data structures using asynchronous semantic logging (ASL). ASL is generic enough to allow programmers to add persistence to the existing volatile data structure (e.g., C++ Standard Template Library containers) with very little programming effort. Furthermore, ASL moves most durability code off the critical path, and our evaluation shows Pronto data structures outperform highly-optimized NVMM data structures written with other libraries by a large margin.},

characterization in MLC flash, we propose an error-correcting scheme which
outperforms the conventional BCH code. We compare several schemes which use
an MLC flash block as an SLC block. Finally, an implementation of two-write
WOM-codes in SLC flash is given as well as the BER for the first and second

abstract = {Non-volatile memories (such as NAND flash and phase change memories) have
the potential to revolutionize computer systems. However, these
technologies have complex behavior in terms of performance, reliability,
and energy consumption that make fully exploiting their potential a
complicated task. As device engineers push bit densities higher, this
complexity will only increase. Managing and exploiting the complex and at
times surprising behavior of these memories requires a deep understanding
of the devices grounded in experimental results. Our research groups have
developed several hardware test beds for flash and other memories that
allow us to both characterize these memories and experimentally evaluate
their performance on full-scale computer systems. We describe several of
these test bed systems, outline some of the research findings they have
enabled, and discuss some of the methodological challenges they raise.},

abstract = {POSIX-style read() and write() have long been the standard interface for accessing data in files. However, the data copy into and out of memory these methods require imposes an unnecessary overhead when files are stored in fast persistent memories (PMEMs). To avoid the copy, PMEM-aware file systems generally provide direct-access (DAX)-based mmap(), but in doing so force the programmer to manage write-atomicity and concurrent accesses to the file.In this work, we propose two new system calls - peek() and patch(), and collectively called SubZero - that read and update PMEM-backed files without any copies. To show its potential, we implemented SubZero in two state-of-the-art PMEM file systems, XFS-DAX and NOVA. Measurements of simple benchmarks show that SubZero can outperform copy-based read() and write() by up to 2x and 2.8x, respectively. At the application level, peek() improves GET performance of the Apache Web Server by 3.6x, and patch() boosts SET performance of Kyoto Cabinet up to 1.3x.},
