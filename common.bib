abstract = {A 4-Gb AG-AND flash memory was fabricated by using a 90-nm CMOS technology. To reduce cell size, an inversion-layer-bit-line technology was developed, enabling the elimination of both shallow trench isolations and diffusion layers from the memory cells. The inversion-layer-bit-line technology combined with a multilevel cell technique achieved a bit area 2F2 of 0.0162 {micro}m2, resulting in a chip size of 126 mm2. Both an address and temperature compensation techniques control the resistance of the inversion-layer local bit line. Source-side hot-electron injection programming with self-boosted charge, accumulated in inversion-layer bit lines under assist gates, reduces the dispersal of programming characteristics and also reduces the time overhead of pre-charging the bit lines. This self-boosted charge-injection scheme achieves a programming throughput of 10 MB/s.

The NAND cell arrays are formed on the ILD as well as on the bulk to double the memory density without increasing the chip size. The feasibility of the technology was proven by the successful operation of 32 bit NAND flash memory cell strings with 63nm dimension and TANOS structures. The novel NAND cell operational scheme, so called SBT (source-body tied) scheme, is presented to maximize the advantages of 3 dimensionally stacked NAND cell structures},

abstract={This paper describes a novel high-density 4.4F2 (F: feature size) NAND flash memory with the cell size of 0.074 um2 for 0.13 um design rule. To minimize the cell size, two key technologies are introduced as follows. (1) The Super-Shallow Channel Profile (SSCP) engineering and (2) a novel layout of the NAND string that consists of 32 cells. The NAND cells fabricated by the above technologies have demonstrated good cell characteristics. This 4.4F2 NAND flash technology is highly advantageous for low cost flash memories of 4 Gbit and beyond for mass storage applications },

A breakthrough patterning technology of Self Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) together with ArF lithography is applied to three critical lithographic steps. Other key integration technologies include low thermal budget ILD process and twisted bit-line contact for excellent isolation between adjacent bit lines. Hemi-Cylindrical FET (HCFET) together with charge trapping memory cell of Si/SiO2 /SiN/Al2O3/TaN (TANOS) was found to be effective in sufficing various electrical requirements of 30 nm generation flash cells. Finally, MLC operation is successfully demonstrated with flash cells of 8 Gb density in which all the technologies aforementioned are combined.},

	drives based on the giant magnetoresistance phenomenon. The discovery
	of tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions has allowed
	the emergence of a new kind of non-volatile memory called magnetic
	random access memory (MRAM). It potentially combines the advantages
	of all existing memories: non-volatility of FLASH, speed of SRAM,
	density of DRAM, hardness to ionizing radiations and endurance. Many
	research groups are nowadays investigating the use of these magnetic
	components for other logic applications. Spintronic phenomenon is
	the spin transfer effect allows controlling the magnetization of
	a magnetic nanostructure directly with a spin-polarized current.
	It attracts a considerable interest since it provides a new write
	scheme in MRAM and allows conceiving frequency tunable RF components.},

  abstract = {A novel nonvolatile memory utilizing spin torque transfer magnetization
	switching (STS), abbreviated spin-RAM hereafter, is presented for
	the first time. The spin-RAM is programmed by magnetization reversal
	through an interaction of a spin momentum-torque-transferred current
	and a magnetic moment of memory layers in magnetic tunnel junctions
	(MTJs), and therefore an external magnetic field is unnecessary as
	that for a conventional MRAM. This new programming mode has been
	accomplished owing to our tailored MTJ, which has an oval shape of
	100 times 150 nm. The memory cell is based on a 1-transistor and
	a 1-MTJ (ITU) structure. The 4kbit spin-RAM was fabricated on a 4
	level metal, 0.18 mum CMOS process. In this work, writing speed as
	high as 2 ns, and a write current as low as 200 muA were successfully
	demonstrated. It has been proved that spin-RAM possesses outstanding
	characteristics such as high speed, low power and high scalability
	for the next generation universal memory},

	To reduce cell size, an inversion-layer-bit-line technology was developed,

	layers from the memory cells. The inversion-layer-bit-line technology
	combined with a multilevel cell technique achieved a bit area 2F2
	of 0.0162 {micro}m2, resulting in a chip size of 126 mm2. Both an
	address and temperature compensation techniques control the resistance
	of the inversion-layer local bit line. Source-side hot-electron injection
	programming with self-boosted charge, accumulated in inversion-layer
	bit lines under assist gates, reduces the dispersal of programming
	characteristics and also reduces the time overhead of pre-charging
	the bit lines. This self-boosted charge-injection scheme achieves
	a programming throughput of 10 MB/s.},
